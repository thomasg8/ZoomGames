# ZoomGames
Home and bored during quarentine, I decided to recreate some of my favorite drinking card games for my friends and I to play on Zoom. 

To play, simply run Play.py.

## 1. Cube

To play Cube, you must guess higher or lower on a card in the cube. A 'turn' consists of 3 correct guesses in a row. If you get one wrong, you drink for how ever many cards are in the pile. 

## 2. Ride the Bus
